        "description": "Raise money for the world's most effective charities through your everyday online shoppings with no extra costs. You can start helping people in extreme poverty with no extra effort or costs. Just install the extension, and when you buy something online, people living in severe poverty will get medicines, bed nets, or financial aid. There are no extra costs for you (the charity donation is covered by our partner stores). We’ve partnered with online stores (including Ebay, Aliexpress, Etsy, Microsoft) to create a unique loyalty program. For every purchase you make in one of our partners’ stores, portion of the money goes to extremely effective, research-backed charities. That way, users can support great causes with no costs, and shops gain clients strongly incentivized to buy from them and not their competition. It works with 1000+ shops including Ebay, Barnes & Noble, Aliexpress, and Etsy. For every $4.85 raised for Against Malaria Foundation two people are protected from malaria (via bed nets) and for every $1.19 raised for Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, one child gets a year supply of medicine. Everyone wins!",

                130 billion animals suffer every day on factory farms. They are raised and
                slaughtered in conditions causing extreme distress. For example, broiler chickens
                are often packed up to 19 chickens in a square metre. This is a little less than an
                A4 page for one bird.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fortunately, there are effective ways to stop it. Open Philanthropy estimated that
                for every $1 spend on campaigns aiming to convince large companies to reduce their
                impact on animal suffering, around 38 hens were spared.

              <p class="question">How does it work?</p>
              <p class="answer">
                In short, after installing Altruisto, when you visit one of our partner stores you
                will see a special box with a button saying “Activate donation.” When you click this
                button, you will be redirected back to the partner store (exactly where you were
                before). When you buy something, Altruisto receives a portion of the price you pay
                (usually between 2% and 6%). We donate that portion to carefully selected charities.
                Some stores will require you to repeat the process after some time.
              </p>

              <p class="question">Does it cost me anything to use Altruisto?</p>
              <p class="answer">
                No, Altruisto is absolutely free to use. The prices in the online stores are exactly
                the same whether you use altruisto or not.
              </p>

              <p class="question">How can I be sure that the money will be donated to charities?</p>
              <p class="answer">Altruisto is set up as Community Interest Company.</p>
              <p class="answer">
                From Wikipedia:<br />
                <em
                  >A community interest company (CIC) is a type of company introduced by the United

              <p class="question">What percentage of the purchase is donated to charities?</p>
              <p class="answer">
                Altruisto receives usually 2-6% of the final purchase price. The percentage depends
                on the shop and the particular product.
              </p>

              <p class="question">What stores does Altruisto work with?</p>
              <p class="answer">
                We have partnered with several big e-commerce businesses such as Ebay, Microsoft,
                Booking.com, Aliexpress, Etsy, Barnes&amp;Noble, and over 1000 others. A full list
                of partner stores can be found at:
                <a href="https://altruisto.com/partners" target="_blank"

                >
              </p>

              <p class="question">What charities do you support and why these and not others?</p>
              <p class="answer">
                The charities we've chosen to support have been recommended by either GiveWell or
                Animal Charity Evaluators, organizations that do in-depth research into how well
                charities do what they are supposed to do and chooses the best ones. As a result,
                the charities we support are exceptional at improving the lives of people living in
                extreme poverty or, in this case, reducing animal suffering.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                Selected charities are evidence-backed, thoroughly vetted, and underfunded.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                Therefore, you can be sure the money they receive from your online shopping is used
                to do as much good as possible. Also, because the charities are so efficient with
                their funds, every small purchase in altruisto's partners' shops makes a real
                difference.

            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p class="question">
                I am not buying in any of these stores, is there any reason for me to install
                Altruisto?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">Yes, there are three reasons:</p>
              <p class="answer">
                1) We are constantly working on new partnerships, so we may partner with stores that
                you do use in the near future. It’s easier to have it already installed rather than
                regularly check if stores that you use have been added.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                2) If you even once decide to buy from our partners stores, having Altruisto already
                installed can be a difference of sparing a life of an animal. It’s better to have it installed just in case, rather
                than miss an easy opportunity to do a lot of good for free.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                3) It is easier to establish new partnerships with a bigger userbase: the more users
                Altruisto has, the easier it is to convince new stores to join our initiative.
                Therefore, by installing Altruisto, you make it more probable that we will partner
                with shops you use in the future.
              </p>

              <p class="question">
                I only shop at Amazon and already use Amazon Smile program, is there any reason for
                me to install Altruisto?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                First of all,
                <strong>our partners usually donate 4-12 times more</strong>
                through Altruisto (2-6%) than Amazon does through Amazon Smile (only 0.5% of the
                final price). So, if you care about having as big a positive impact on the world as
                you can, using Altruisto either instead of or in addition to Amazon Smile is a way
                to achieve that.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                Moreover, there are a lot of products or services available in our partner stores
                that are not available on Amazon. For example, travel services (hotels, flights,
                train tickets, car rentals), financial products, or sport clubs’ official apparel.
              </p>

              <p class="question">How do shops benefit from being in Altruisto program?</p>
              <p class="answer">
                1) Our users are clients who have a strong incentive to buy from our partner shops
                and not their competition.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                2) We are preparing multiple new features such as highlighting partners' websites in
                search results or informing the user when the product they are going to buy is
                available for the same price in one of our partners' stores. These features directly
                drive new consumers to partners' stores.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                3) Last, but definitely not least, thanks to Altruisto, our partners' brands are
                associated with a great cause.
              </p>

              <p class="question">Does Altruisto track my purchases or internet activity?</p>
              <p class="answer">
                No, we do not. We do get information about what kind of products are purchased and
                how many items our users bought each month, but we do not track individual users'
                purchases. You can find out more in our
                <a href="https://altruisto.com/privacy-policy.html" target="_blank"
                  >Privacy Policy</a
                >
                (we’ve tried to keep it simple and easy to understand).
              </p>

              <p class="question">
                Why installing Altruisto requires permission to “Read and change all data on
                websites you visit”?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                For the extension to work properly it needs to have access to the information about
                what website you have opened to know if you're on one of our partners' sites (hence
                the "read data on websites" part) and be able to add new elements to the site (i.e.
                a box that displays a button for raising money. Hence the "change data on websites"
                part). In short, the extension downloads the list of partner shops, then works in
                the background, comparing the website you're viewing against the downloaded list,
                and if there is a match, it shows a special button.
                <strong
                  >The information about visited websites does not leave your computer, so your
                  privacy is protected.</strong
                >
              </p>
              <p class="answer">

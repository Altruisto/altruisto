        "description": "Raise money for the world's most effective charities through your everyday online shoppings with no extra costs. You can start helping people in extreme poverty with no extra effort or costs. Just install an extension, and when you buy something online, people living in severe poverty will get medicines, bed nets, or financial aid. There are no extra costs for you (the charity donation is covered by our partner stores). We’ve partnered with online stores (including Ebay, Aliexpress, Etsy, Microsoft) to create a unique loyalty program. For every purchase you make in one of our partners’ stores, portion of the money goes to extremely effective, research-backed charities. That way, users can support great causes with no costs, and shops gain clients strongly incentivized to buy from them and not their competition. It works with 1000+ shops including Ebay, Barnes & Noble, Aliexpress, and Etsy. For every $4.85 raised for Against Malaria Foundation two people are protected from malaria (via bed nets) and for every $1.19 raised for Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, one child gets a year supply of medicine. Everyone wins!",

                        The charities we've chosen to support
                        <strong>have been recommended by GiveWell.org</strong>,
                        an organization that does
                        <strong>in-depth research</strong> into how well
                        charities do what they are supposed to do and chooses
                        the best ones. As a result, the charities we support are
                        exceptional at improving the lives of people living in
                        extreme poverty. And you don't have to spend your time
                        verifying if the charity you want to support is good,
                        does their job well, doesn't pay ridiculous salaries to
                        the founders, etc.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <u><strong>Selected charities are evidence-backed, thoroughly
                            vetted, and underfunded.</strong></u>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Because of all that you can be sure that the money they
                        receive from your online shopping is used to do as much
                        good as possible. Also, because the charities are so
                        efficient with their funds, every small purchase in
                        Altruisto's partners' shops makes a difference.

                      <strong>Against Malaria Foundation</strong>
                      <p>
                        Malaria is a major problem in sub-Saharan Africa. Over 1
                        million people—mostly children—die from malaria each
                        year. Insecticide-treated bed nets prevent deaths and
                        many other non-fatal cases of malaria, and are
                        relatively inexpensive: about $4.85 per net.

                        SCI supports programs that treat people for parasitic
                        worm infections that cause short-term symptoms such as
                        anemia, and may cause longer-term developmental
                        problems. These worms are very inexpensive to treat. It
                        costs only $1.19 to treat one person.

                        Directly transferring money to poor individuals allows
                        them to purchase what they believe will help them most.
                        Strong evidence indicates that cash transfers lead
                        recipients to spend more on their basic needs (such as
                        food) and may allow recipients to make investments with
                        high returns, with no evidence of large increases in
                        spending on items like alcohol or tobacco.

                      Usually, most partners share 2-6% of the price with the
                      charities we support. Some share more, some share less.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        So far, Etsy shared ~9%, so
                        <pre>$39 x 9% = $3.51</pre>
                        Treating one child from parasites costs $1.19, so with
                        $3.51 we can treat ~3 children.
                        <p></p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Ebay shared ~3.5%, so
                        <pre>$150 x 3.5% = $5.25</pre>
                        Distributing one bed net protecting on average two
                        people from malaria costs $4.85. With the donation from
                        eBay we can afford one bed net.
                        <p></p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Booking.com shared ~3%, so
                        <pre>$700 x 3% = $21</pre>
                        Financial aid of $1000 can help to support one family
                        living in extreme poverty for one year. Since 91% of
                        donations to GiveDirectly ends up in the hands of the
                        poor, for a year's worth of financial support we need to
                        donate
                        <pre>$1000 / 91% = $1098.90</pre>
                        $1098.90 divided by 52 weeks in a year equals to $21.13
                        which we can cover from the booking's exemplary donation
                        (without the 13 cents).

              <p class="question">How does it work?</p>
              <p class="answer">
                In short, after installing Altruisto, when you visit one of our
                partner stores you will see a special box with a button saying
                “Activate donation.” When you click this button, you will be redirected back to the partner store
                (exactly where you were before). When you buy
                something, Altruisto receives a portion of the price you pay
                (usually between 2% and 6%). We donate our profits to carefully
                selected charities. Some stores will require you to repeat the
                process after some time.
              </p>

              <p class="question">
                Does it cost me anything to use Altruisto?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                No, Altruisto is absolutely free to use. The prices in the
                online stores are exactly the same whether you use altruisto
                or not.
              </p>

              <p class="question">
                How can I be sure that the money will be donated to charities?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                Altruisto is set up as Community Interest Company.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                From Wikipedia:<br>
                <em>A community interest company (CIC) is a type of company
                  introduced by the United Kingdom government in 2005 under the
                  Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act
                  2004, designed for social enterprises that want to use their
                  profits and assets for the public good. CICs are intended to

              <p class="question">
                What percentage of the purchase is donated to charities?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                Altruisto receives usually 2-6% of the final purchase price. The
                percentage depends on the shop and the particular product.
              </p>

              <p class="question">
                What stores does Altruisto work with?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                We have partnered with several big e-commerce businesses such as
                Ebay, Microsoft, Booking.com, Aliexpress, Etsy, Barnes&amp;Noble,
                and over 1000 others. A full list of partner stores can be found
                at:
                <a href="https://altruisto.com/partners" target="_blank">https://altruisto.com/partners</a>
              </p>

              <p class="question">
                What charities do you support and why these and not others?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                We have several cause areas you can choose from when you create an account. You can support the fight against extreme poverty, with Against Malaria Foundation, Schistosomiasis Control
                Initiative, and Give Directly. You can also support the fight against animal suffering, with Anima International.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                The charities we've chosen to support have been recommended by
                either GiveWell or Animal Charity Evaluators, organizations that do in-depth research into
                how well charities do what they are supposed to do and chooses
                the best ones. As a result, the charities we support are
                exceptional at improving the lives of people living in extreme
                poverty or reducing animal suffering.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                Selected charities are evidence-backed, thoroughly vetted, and
                underfunded.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                Therefore, you can be sure the money they receive from your
                online shopping is used to do as much good as possible. Also,
                because the charities are so efficient with their funds, every
                small purchase in altruisto's partners' shops makes a real
                difference.

            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p class="question">
                I am not buying in any of these stores, is there any reason for
                me to install Altruisto?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                Yes, there are three reasons:
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                1) We are constantly working on new partnerships, so we may
                partner with stores that you do use in the near future. It’s
                easier to have it already installed rather than regularly check
                if stores that you use have been added.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                2) If you even once decide to buy from our partners stores,
                having Altruisto already installed can be a difference of curing
                one child from parasitic worms or protecting a couple people
                from malaria. It’s better to have it installed just in case,
                rather than miss an easy opportunity to do a lot of good for
                free.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                3) It is easier to establish new partnerships with a bigger
                userbase: the more users Altruisto has, the easier it is to
                convince new stores to join our initiative. Therefore, by
                installing Altruisto, you make it more probable that we will
                partner with shops you use in the future.
              </p>

              <p class="question">
                I only shop at Amazon and already use Amazon Smile program, is
                there any reason for me to install Altruisto?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                First of all,
                <strong>our partners usually donate 4-12 times more</strong>
                through Altruisto (2-6%) than Amazon does through Amazon Smile
                (only 0.5% of the final price). So, if you care about having as
                big a positive impact on the world as you can, using Altruisto
                either instead of or in addition to Amazon Smile is a way to
                achieve that.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                Moreover, there are a lot of products or services available in
                our partner stores that are not available on Amazon. For
                example, travel services (hotels, flights, train tickets, car
                rentals), financial products, or sport clubs’ official apparel.
              </p>

              <p class="question">
                How do shops benefit from being in Altruisto program?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                1) Our users are clients who have a strong incentive to buy from
                our partner shops and not their competition.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                2) We are preparing multiple new features such as highlighting
                partners' websites in search results or informing the user when
                the product they are going to buy is available for the same
                price in one of our partners' stores. These features directly
                drive new consumers to partners' stores.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                3) Last, but definitely not least, thanks to Altruisto, our
                partners' brands are associated with a great cause.
              </p>

              <p class="question">
                Does Altruisto track my purchases or internet activity?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                No, we do not. We do get information about what kind of products
                are purchased and how many items our users bought each month,
                but we do not track individual users' purchases. You can find
                out more in our
                <a href="https://altruisto.com/privacy-policy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>
                (we’ve tried to keep it simple and easy to understand).
              </p>

              <p class="question">
                Why installing Altruisto requires permission to “Read and change
                all data on websites you visit”?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                For the extension to work properly it needs to have access to
                the information about what website you have opened to know if
                you're on one of our partners' sites (hence the "read data on
                websites" part) and be able to add new elements to the site
                (i.e. a box that displays a button for raising money. Hence the
                "change data on websites" part). In short, the extension
                downloads the list of partner shops, then works in the
                background, comparing the website you're viewing against the
                downloaded list, and if there is a match, it shows a special
                button.
                <strong>The information about visited websites does not leave your
                  computer, so your privacy is protected.</strong>

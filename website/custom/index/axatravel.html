        "description": "Raise money for the world's most effective charities through your everyday online shoppings with no extra costs. You can start helping people in extreme poverty with no extra effort or costs. Just install an extension, and when you buy something online, people living in severe poverty will get medicines, bed nets, or financial aid. There are no extra costs for you (the charity donation is covered by our partner stores). We’ve partnered with online stores (including Ebay, Aliexpress, Etsy, Microsoft) to create a unique loyalty program. For every purchase you make in one of our partners’ stores, portion of the money goes to extremely effective, research-backed charities. That way, users can support great causes with no costs, and shops gain clients strongly incentivized to buy from them and not their competition. It works with 1000+ shops including Ebay, Barnes & Noble, Aliexpress, and Etsy. For every $4.85 raised for Against Malaria Foundation two people are protected from malaria (via bed nets) and for every $1.19 raised for Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, one child gets a year supply of medicine. Everyone wins!",

                In short, after installing Altruisto, when you visit one of our partner stores you
                will see a special box with a button saying “Activate donation.” When you click this
                button, you will be redirected back to the partner store (exactly where you were
                before). When you buy something, Altruisto receives a portion of the price you pay
                (usually between 2% and 6%). We donate our profits to carefully selected charities.
                Some stores will require you to repeat the process after some time.

              <p class="question">
                Does it cost me anything to use Altruisto?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                No, Altruisto is absolutely free to use. The prices in the online stores are exactly
                the same whether you use altruisto or not.
              </p>

              <p class="question">
                How can I be sure that the money will be donated to charities?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                Altruisto is set up as Community Interest Company.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                From Wikipedia:<br />
                <em
                  >A community interest company (CIC) is a type of company introduced by the United
                  Kingdom government in 2005 under the Companies (Audit, Investigations and
                  Community Enterprise) Act 2004, designed for social enterprises that want to use
                  their profits and assets for the public good. CICs are intended to be easy to set
                  up, with all the flexibility and certainty of the company form, but with some
                  special features to ensure they are working for the benefit of the community.</em

              <p class="question">
                What percentage of the purchase is donated to charities?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                Altruisto receives usually 2-6% of the final purchase price. The percentage depends
                on the shop and the particular product. In case of Axa Travel Insurance charities
                will receive 10%-20% of what you spend.
              </p>

              <p class="question">
                What other stores does Altruisto work with?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                We have partnered with several big e-commerce businesses such as Ebay, Microsoft,
                Booking.com, Aliexpress, Etsy, Barnes&amp;Noble, and over 1000 others. A full list
                of partner stores can be found at:

              <p class="question">
                What charities do you support and why these and not others?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                We have several cause areas you can choose from when you create an account. You can
                support the fight against the corona virus with Oxfam GB, fight agains extreme
                poverty, with Against Malaria Foundation, Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, and
                Give Directly. You can also support the fight against animal suffering, with Anima
                International.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                The charities we've chosen to support have been recommended by either GiveWell, The
                Life You Can Save, or Animal Charity Evaluators, organizations that do in-depth
                research into how well charities do what they are supposed to do and chooses the
                best ones. As a result, the charities we support are exceptional at improving the
                lives of people living in extreme poverty or reducing animal suffering.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                Selected charities are evidence-backed, thoroughly vetted, and underfunded.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                Therefore, you can be sure the money they receive from your online shopping is used
                to do as much good as possible. Also, because the charities are so efficient with
                their funds, every small purchase in altruisto's partners' shops makes a real
                difference.

              <p class="question">
                How do shops benefit from being in Altruisto program?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                1) Our users are clients who have a strong incentive to buy from our partner shops
                and not their competition.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                2) We are preparing multiple new features such as highlighting partners' websites in
                search results or informing the user when the product they are going to buy is
                available for the same price in one of our partners' stores. These features directly
                drive new consumers to partners' stores.
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                3) Last, but definitely not least, thanks to Altruisto, our partners' brands are
                associated with a great cause.
              </p>

              <p class="question">
                Does Altruisto track my purchases or internet activity?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                No, we do not. We do get information about what kind of products are purchased and
                how many items our users bought each month, but we do not track individual users'
                purchases. You can find out more in our

              </p>

              <p class="question">
                Why installing Altruisto requires permission to “Read and change all data on
                websites you visit”?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                For the extension to work properly it needs to have access to the information about
                what website you have opened to know if you're on one of our partners' sites (hence
                the "read data on websites" part) and be able to add new elements to the site (i.e.
                a box that displays a button for raising money. Hence the "change data on websites"
                part). In short, the extension downloads the list of partner shops, then works in
                the background, comparing the website you're viewing against the downloaded list,
                and if there is a match, it shows a special button.

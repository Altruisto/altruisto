      - an app that lets users donate money to charities while shopping online. At no extra cost. We
      have over 1000 partner shops including eBay, AliExpress, Booking.com, Etsy, Microsoft. The
      donation is usually between 2% and 6% of the price of the product.
    </p>

    <p>
      We&#x27;re a social enterprise and this is a not-for-profit project - all the profits are
      donated to charities. We&#x27;re self-funded and still in an early stage so you have a chance
      to play a huge part in building our product and company.

        are <strong>proactive</strong>. You&#x27;re the type of person who after finishing a

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul id="fd843b13-8eed-4ab9-b678-97bb6a0ad728">
      <li>
        Your written English is perfect and you actually
        <strong>enjoy writing.</strong> A huge part of the job is writing - emails, tweets,
        copywriting for web pages, emails, and more emails. Also, have we mentioned emails?
      </li>

    <ul id="eb28b534-9b52-4217-a16a-f406b3cb78e7">

    <ul id="9eca25a3-818d-4bd6-b5bb-9b20b08893b4">

        You can pick up how to use new tools and you&#x27;re not afraid to experiment with them.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We don&#x27;t care about your formal education or if you had previous experience in marketing
      or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      We care about what type of person and you are and whether you can learn needed skills on the
      go. If you&#x27;re thoughtful, kind, conscientious.
    </p>
    <h2>Recruitment process</h2>
    <p>
      Please send us your resume to hello@altruisto.com and fill out{" "}
      <a
        href="https://forms.gle/EfASBJkVAkFV3uDs6"

      .
    </p>
    <p id="a9e39499-d714-482e-b81d-1c9285611168">
      If we think we&#x27;re a match we&#x27;ll invite you to an interview. The interview takes
      60-90 minutes and is conducted via Google Meet. We&#x27;ll talk about your past and our
      future. We&#x27;ll ask questions about your past work and you&#x27;ll ask questions about
      whatever you want.
    </p>
    <p id="e2dc1204-5e47-4791-8df2-95f5532bee87">
      The last part is a small exemplary project that should take up to 2 hours (but probably much
      less than that). We do realise this is a big commitment so there is no deadline for turning in
      your results. The project will be similar to something we actually work on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that we&#x27;re unable to provide individual feedback about your performance in
      the recruitment process. We&#x27;re a small team and we simply don&#x27;t have the capacity to
      offer personalised feedback.
